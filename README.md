This repository contains the source for our Sonatype OSPO Website - the published version can be viewed [here](https://ospo.sonatype.com).

This project is based from [Docsy for Hugo](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/get-started/docsy-as-module/installation-prerequisites/#install-hugo).

## Usage

### Prerequisite Tools

You'll need the following tools installed locally for development:
- [Hugo Extended](https://gohugo.io) (>=0.128.0)
- NPM 

You can find out more about how to install Hugo for your environment in our
[Getting started](https://www.docsy.dev/docs/getting-started/#prerequisites-and-installation) guide.

### Running the website locally

Ensure `npm install` has been run - this ensures `PostCSS` is installed.

Once you've made your working copy of the site repo, from the repo root folder, run:

```bash
hugo server
```

### Running a container locally

You can run docsy-example inside a [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
container, the container runs with a volume bound to the `docsy-example`
folder. This approach doesn't require you to install any dependencies other
than [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on
Windows and Mac, and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
on Linux.

1. Build the docker image

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

1. Run the built image

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

   > NOTE: You can run both commands at once with `docker-compose up --build`.

1. Verify that the service is working.

   Open your web browser and type `http://localhost:1313` in your navigation bar,
   This opens a local instance of the docsy-example homepage. You can now make
   changes to the docsy example and those changes will immediately show up in your
   browser after you save.
